# Spirograph
### Overview
This project uses Python’s turtle graphics module to generate a colorful spiral pattern by repeatedly drawing circles with gradually changing headings and randomly generated colors.

The program demonstrates how simple geometric transformations combined with randomness can be used to create visually appealing patterns.
